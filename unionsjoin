-- UNION AND JOINS
-- 1. Extract information on pet name and owner names side-by-side

-- side by side means join

select p.name pet_name, o.name owner_name
from dbb.pets p
left join dbb.owners o
on cast(p.ownerid as int) = o.ownerid

-- 2. Find out which pets from this clinic had procedures performed

select p.name, ph.*
from dbb.pets p
left join dbb.procedureshistory ph
on p.petid = ph.petid
where ph.petid is not null

select p.name, ph.*
from dbb.pets p
inner join dbb.procedureshistory ph
on p.petid = ph.petid

-- 3. Match up all procedures performed to their descriptions

select ph.*, pd.description
from dbb.procedureshistory ph
left join dbb.proceduresdetails pd
on ph.proceduresubcode = pd.proceduresubcode and ph.proceduretype = pd.proceduretype

-- 4. Extract a table of total costs (procedure prices) incurred by each owner from the clinic (this table should have owner and procedure price side-by-side)

select *
from dbb.procedureshistory ph
left join dbb.pets p
on ph.petid = p.petid
left join dbb.owners o
on cast(p.ownerid as int) = o.ownerid
left join dbb.proceduresdetails pd
on ph.proceduresubcode = pd.proceduresubcode and ph.proceduretype = pd.proceduretype

select p.ownerid, sum(pd.price) as total_cost
from dbb.pets p
inner join dbb.procedureshistory ph
on ph.petid = p.petid
left join dbb.proceduresdetails pd
on ph.proceduresubcode = pd.proceduresubcode and ph.proceduretype = pd.proceduretype
group by 1

-- 5. Write an SQL statement to select unique PetIDs that are Dogs or have gone through hospitalization.

select petid
from dbb.pets
where kind = 'Dog'
UNION
select petid
from dbb.procedureshistory
where proceduretype = 'HOSPITALIZATION'

-- EXTRA NOTE
CTE common table expression
with base as (
select petid
from dbb.pets
where kind = 'Dog'
UNION
select petid
from dbb.procedureshistory
where proceduretype = 'HOSPITALIZATION'
	)
select b.*, p.kind
from base b
left join dbb.pets p
on b.petid = p.petid
